Tutor Management System - Data Structures Assignment
This repository contains the source code for a Tutor Management System, developed as part of a data structures assignment. The project focuses on implementing and utilizing various data structures in Java, including ArrayList, LinkedHashMap, and custom interfaces to manage data efficiently within a software system.

Project Overview
The Tutor Management System is designed to handle the management of tutors, courses, and programs within an educational environment. It includes functionalities such as managing tutor assignments, tracking teaching schedules, and organizing course details, leveraging the following core components:

ArrayList.java: Implements dynamic array functionality for managing collections of objects.
LinkedHashMap.java and LinkedHashMapInterface.java: Provides an ordered map implementation that maintains a linked list of the entries for predictable iteration order.
ListInterface.java: A custom interface for defining list operations, ensuring flexibility and adaptability for different list implementations.
Main.java: The entry point for the application, coordinating the initialization and execution of the Tutor Management System.
Teaching.java, Course.java, Programme.java: Defines the data models for representing teaching assignments, courses, and academic programs.
TutorManagementModule.java and TutorManagement.java: Manages core functionalities of tutor scheduling, course allocation, and program management.
Key Features
Efficient management of tutor data, courses, and programs.
Application of various data structures to ensure optimized performance.
Flexible and modular code design for easy integration and scalability.
Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used for implementing the data structures and overall system.
Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes principles of OOP to create modular and reusable components.
Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or provide suggestions for improvements!
